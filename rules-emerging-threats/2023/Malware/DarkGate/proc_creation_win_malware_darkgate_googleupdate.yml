description: This rule alerts on instances of uncommon or suspicious behavior involving the "GoogleUpdate.exe" process, particularly in the context of activities associated with the threat actor group known as "DarkGate."
  DarkGate is a threat group known for its involvement in cyber-espionage and other malicious activities. The rule focuses on identifying any deviations from normal behavior related to the execution or spawning of
  "GoogleUpdate.exe," which may indicate potential malicious activity or lateral movement by DarkGate within the network. Detection of such unusual spawning behavior can help security teams respond promptly to potential threats and
  enhance overall network security.
