title: Mail forwarding to external recipients
id: bd1a451e-620e-493f-82b7-016b2796cbbb
status: experimental
description: Email forwarding can be set up by both administrators and users. Itâ€™s very important to monitor these kind of events to detect insider threats. The difference is that administrators can set up new mail transport rules that affect one or multiple users within Exchange Online while users can only do it on their own mailbox from the Outlook client.
