id: b48492dc-c5ef-4572-8dff-32bc241c15c8
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the load of RstrtMgr DLL (Restart Manager) by suspicious processes.
    This librairy has been used during ransomware campaigns to kill processes that would prevent file encryption by locking them (Conti Ransomware, Cactus Ransomware). It has also been seen recently in the BiBi wiper for Windows.
    It could also be used for anti-analysis purposes by shut downing specific processes.
