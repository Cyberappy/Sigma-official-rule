## What is Sigma

Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file.

The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others.

Sigma is for log files what [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) is for network traffic and [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) is for files.

## Why Sigma

Today, everyone collects log data for analysis. People start working on their own, processing numerous white papers, blog posts and log analysis guidelines, extracting the necessary information and build their own searches and dashboard. Some of their searches and correlations are great and very useful but they lack a standardized format in which they can share their work with others.

Others provide excellent analyses, include IOCs and YARA rules to detect the malicious files and network connections, but have no way to describe a specific or generic detection method in log events. Sigma is meant to be an open standard in which such detection mechanisms can be defined, shared and collected in order to improve the detection capabilities for everyone.

## Key Features

* Describe your detection method in Sigma to make it shareable
* Write your SIEM/EDR searches in Sigma to avoid a vendor lock-in
* Share the signature in the appendix of your analysis along with IOCs and YARA rules
* Share the signature in threat intel communities - e.g. via MISP
* Provide Sigma signatures for malicious behavior in your own application

## Getting Started

### Rule Creation

Florian wrote a short [rule creation tutorial](https://www.nextron-systems.com/2018/02/10/write-sigma-rules/) that can help you getting started. Use the [Rule Creation Guide](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/wiki/Rule-Creation-Guide) in our Wiki for a clear guidance on how to populate the various field in Sigma rules.

### Rule Usage and Conversion

* Use [Sigma CLI](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-cli) to convert your rules into queries.
* Use [pySigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma) to integrate Sigma in your own toolchain or product.
